# Banking-App
A large Bank has commissioned you to develop a prototype computerised system for use in their local branches. 

This branch has been created by Kevin, Marie, Mubasher and James.

By demo time, the App and all its classes had been written. The menu was working and all options were selectable.
The App was also creating 100 business and 100 personal accounts, with varying types of accounts attached to each and a random balance assigned.

The only things left were the reporting modules for listing customers, accounts and auditing the accounts.
